Following tutorial from "Become a full stack developer with spring aws and stripe" course.

# How to build
Run the following command:

mvn clean install

#Spring Tools Suit

Create a new Spring Starter Project. Create a new Controller Class, and an index.html file under the "src/main/resources/template" folder. Create a method in the Controller class, with 'return "index";'. Annotate this method with @RequestMapping("/").

# Notes
I used Spring Tools Suit (STS) for this course (the instructor recommends IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, which is a great IDE, but a bit expensive)
